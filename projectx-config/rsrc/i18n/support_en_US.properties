m.file_a_complaint = FILE A COMPLAINT

m.header_step1 = You are about to file a complaint against another player for the Game Masters to review.

m.header_step2 = Which offense?

m.subheader_step2 = We have saved the chat log already waiting to be added to the complaint, so there is no need to hurry from here. Please carefully choose the correct option matching what the player did:

m.subheader_step2_email = We have saved the offending email already waiting to be added to the complaint, so there is no need to hurry from here. Please carefully choose the correct option matching what the player did:

m.header_step2-11 = Not Listed:

m.header_step3 = Sending Complaint

m.header_step4 = Thank you!
m.subheader_step4 = Your complaint has been sent, thank you for helping us keep the game an enjoyable environment.\n\nWe read through all complaints filed, but we do not report back to you on what happens with each complaint. And we may not be able to look over your complaint right away, but rest assured they are all read and handled according to our policies.

m.header_step5 = There was a problem
m.subheader_step5 = Your complaint has failed: {0}.

m.header_step200 = Offensive Chat
m.subheader_step200 = Offensive chat is usually swearing, sexual language, violent language or racist language. We do allow some use of offensive chat when it's just considered harmless smack talk, but when it's directed at players and getting personal then it's no longer acceptable.

m.header_step201 = Spamming
m.subheader_step201 = Spamming is when someone repeats text or sends long lines of random characters with the sole purpose of annoying others because it fills up the chat screen so they can't chat normally.\n\nIt's important that you only file a spam complaint when the spamming was so bad that you couldn't chat with others. For example a couple of lines of a few characters, while not necessary perhaps, is not bad enough to file a complaint for. Also if the repeated lines are far between (like 10 seconds between) then it also won't prevent people from chatting, even if it may be annoying that they're just writing nonsense.

m.header_step202 = Annoying
m.subheader_step202 = If the player you're complaining about is annoying then that does not qualify as complaint worthy.\n\nAnnoying are issues like calling you names or teasing you.

m.header_step203 = Underage
m.header_step204 = Offensive name
m.header_step205 = Filed a complaint against me
m.subheader_step205 = You should not be sending a complaint against someone just because they sent a complaint against you.\n\nGame Masters will read through all complaints, and if you didn't break any rules in the complaint that was filed against you, then you don't need to worry.

m.header_step206 = Personal information
m.subheader_step206 = Revealing personal information is not acceptable, whether it is their own or another player's. Asking for personal information is not acceptable either.\n\nAsking people how old they are or what grade they're in or what sorts of sports they do etc. is not considered personal.\n\nBut things like phone numbers or address or real name are personal information and should never be revealed.

m.header_step207 = Scamming
m.subheader_step207 = Scamming is when a player is trying to trick you into doing something you shouldn't do. Examples:\n- This could be trying to reveal your account name or password.\n- Wanting to trade accounts with you.\n- Claiming to be a Game Master or a friend of yours and trying take advantage of that.\nThere are many other ways to scam.

m.header_step208 = Hacking
m.subheader_step208 = Hacking is when someone is trying to get a hold of your account name or password, or already has done this.\n\nThe vast majority of hacking issues, aren't actually hacking, but careless sharing of accounts or passwords. You should never share your password with anyone for any reason. Game Masters will never ask for it either.

m.header_step209 = Wrong trade
m.subheader_step209 = Sometimes we make a mistake when trading with players. This happens to all of us.\n\nBut Game Masters can't know what the agreement with the trade was. One player could claim this wasn't what was agreed on, while the other could claim it was. And we can't just blindly pick a side. So we have to rely on players double checking what they're trading before they click to confirm.\n\nSo if you just made a trade you didn't really mean to, then I'm afraid Game Masters won't be able to assist you. Instead you'll want to talk to the other player and see if the player is nice enough to reverse the trade.\n\nAlso remember never to trade anything away "as a loan" unless you are OK with this player not returning the item. Game Masters won't be able to recover it for you.

m.header_step210 = Not listed

m.option_1_0 = 1. Remember you can click on players and choose "Ignore" to block any chat and mail from them. Click here to ignore {0} and skip the complaint.
m.option_1_1 = 2. If {0} has been offensive or harassing and has not stopped when asked, click here to file a complaint.
m.option_1_2 = 3. If you meant to send a message to {0}, click here.

m.option_2_0 = >Offensive chat

m.option_2_8 = >Hacking
m.option_2_9 = >Wrong trade
m.option_2_10 = >Not listed

m.option_4_0 = If your complaint was for offensive chat, harassment by player etc. then this would be a good time to ignore {0}, so you're never bothered by them again. Playing a game is about having fun, don't let other players ruin this.

m.option_200_0 = We have chat filters in place to remove offensive words. If you have disabled the chat filter then you should not be filing complaints against players for using those offensive words. To enable chat filters instead click here.
m.option_200_1 = Be aware that what you consider offensive and personal may not generally be considered offensive. So please consider carefully if everyone would find that chat offensive. If you have read and understood all this and still wish to send the complaint then click here.

m.option_201_0 = Instead you could simply click here to ignore {0} so you won't have to listen to them again.
m.option_201_1 = If you're convinced this qualified as spamming then click OK to file the complaint.

m.option_202_0 = We realize this player may be ruining some of the fun you're having, but the best way to deal with such annoying players is to ignore them so you don't have to bother with them again. Click here to ignore {0} instead.

m.option_203_0 = You have to be 13 years or older to play this game. If someone admits in chat that they are under 13 then please click here to file the complaint against them.\n\nDo NOT use this option if you simply believe the player to be underage, as there has to be proof in the last few minutes of chat. If there is no proof, then you should drop the complaint. \n\nPlease use common sense, if they claim to be 4 years old while typing perfectly as an example then that's clearly not true and you should not file the complaint.

m.option_204_0 = Names that are offensive are not acceptable. Be aware that what you consider offensive may not generally be considered offensive. So please only click here to file the complaint if you know for sure everyone would find that name offensive.

m.option_206_0 = If there is no doubt this was personal information then please click here to file the complaint.

m.option_207_0 = If you believe someone is maliciously trying to scam you, then please click here to send the complaint. You may want to inform this player they have been complained that way other players around you can hear this too and take precaution.

m.option_208_0 = If a player is trying to get your account name or password from you right now, or already did and is admitting to this in chat, you should click here to file a complaint.
m.option_208_1 = If a player has already taken over your account, you will need to contact us via our support form to recover your account again.\n\nBe aware we need proof of who owns the account, and we can only get this by confirming how the account was paid for.\n\nClick here to start recovering your paid account which was taken over.

m.option_210_0 = You should only be using this option if none of the other options covers your complaint. Click here to go back and see if the other options might be useful.
m.option_210_1 = If you're sure the other options didn't cover your complaint, and you're sure the player broke our Terms of Service, then please enter a short explanation here for what your complaint is.
m.option_210_2 = Submit complaint.

m.button_0 = >Click here to drop the complaint.
