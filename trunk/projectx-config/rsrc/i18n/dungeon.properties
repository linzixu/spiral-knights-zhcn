m.scarlet_fortress_desc = Named for its vibrant tapestries, the Scarlet Fortress is a deconstructed mass of a forgotten castle, drifting endlessly in the void of the Clockworks. Strange bestial ghosts haunt its long corridors, tirelessly pursuing those that enter their domain.

m.aurora_isles_desc = From atop mysterious floating islands, sun bleached ruins crumble under a false sky. Though the green grass and cool air feels real enough, the ever present grinding of the machine just below the surface is a constant reminder of this world's mechanical skeleton.

m.dark_city_desc = This once bustling city from an advanced world is now home to innumerable fiends from the Underworld. Under the light of the moon they burn their dark sigils into the ground, summoning more of their cohorts for reasons yet unknown.

m.concrete_jungle_desc = This long forgotten city was reclaimed by nature and then by the legions of the undead. Now it is a vile nest of malady, home to all manners of toxic monsters, living and otherwise.

m.treasure_vault_desc = Treasure Vaults contain vast quantities of treasure blocks, yours for the taking should you have the proper means to get past the numerous locked doors. Some of them are heavily guarded, so always be on the look out for hidden traps and monsters.

m.graveyard_desc = A graveyard is a terrible place that simultaneously exists in the world of the living and the dead. Though they contain secret treasures in their dark corners, they are home to ancient horrors that wish to consume all who enter. Once inside, finding an exit as fast as possible is advised.

m.jigsaw_valley_desc = Appearing to be sky islands ripped apart and put back together again as if it were a puzzle this world can sometimes be confusing to navigate. Unfortunately it seems to also be home to a host of mindless slimes and constructs who do not seem to mind its erratic layout.

m.royal_jelly_desc = The Royal Jelly Palace is an ancient castle overtaken by a legion of slime monsters. It is unclear what purpose the castle serves, though it is rumored to house a Royal Jelly, said to be nobility within the slime kingdoms. If true then the purpose of the castle is likely to serve the Royal Jelly, and nothing more.

m.gloaming_wildwoods_desc = Spiral Knight recruits are advised to avoid this dark and misty forest until they are experienced with the dangers of the Clockworks. The Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of vicious beasts, the worst of all being the mythical Snarbolax. Said to be 'a living shadow,' the Snarbolax prefers the taste of prey that had been a state of terror before death and will often mercilessly harass its victims before delivering the final blow.

m.ironclaw_munitions_factory_desc = The Ironclaw Munitions Factory is a gremlin-operated weapons factory that specializes in the production of high-calibur explosives.  Intel has revealed that it is developing a secret weapon known as 'Project Roarmulus' designed with the sole purpose of destroying Haven!
