r.reporting_duty_2a = If we could somehow harness that power...

m.prestigious_opportunity_2a = Prestige Missions are entirely optional and cannot be repeated in a single day.  And don't forget to keep an eye out for special missions that offer large prestige rewards!

r.prestigious_opportunity_2a = Thank you, Kora.  I'll do my best.

m.prestigious_opportunity_3a = I have faith in you, {0}.  I just know that you will be among the select Knights skillful enough to reach the Core and with any luck, get us off this planet.

r.prestigious_opportunity_3a = \u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1

m.minerals_rock = Minerals Rock!
o.minerals_rock = Report to Chief Geo Knight Wegner in the Haven Arcade
b.minerals_rock = Chief Geo Knight Wegner is responsible for researching the strange minerals that Knights have begun mining from within the Clockworks.  He believes that they may hold the answer to gaining entry into the Core and retrieving the energy needed to restore the Skylark. \n\nMeet with him in the Haven Arcade and gain an understanding of how you can help his research as well as harness the true power of the Haven Arcade!

n.minerals_rock = Wegner
m.minerals_rock_1a = Hello. I'm Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark and head of geological studies within the Clockworks.

r.minerals_rock_1a = I'm here to learn about the minerals we have been assigned to collect.

# IMAGE: step1_minerals.png
m.minerals_rock_2a = During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals that we use to power these gates: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter. \n\nWe use these minerals to power the gates in the Arcade and generate new levels to explore.

r.minerals_rock_2a = Continue

# IMAGE: step2_gather.png
m.minerals_rock_3a = You will find ore deposits in all levels of the Clockworks, and you must attack them in order to break them down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable. \n\nOnce you safely reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one!

r.minerals_rock_3a = Continue

# IMAGE: step3_deposit.png
m.minerals_rock_4a = Once you complete your expedition and return to the Arcade, you need to deposit your minerals into a dormant gate. \n\nSimply approach any of the deposit boxes in front of a dormant gate and press ATTACK to open the mineral deposit interface.

r.minerals_rock_4a = Continue

# IMAGE: step4_autosell.png
m.minerals_rock_5a = After opening the mineral deposit interface, simply press the "Auto Sell" button and all of your minerals will be deposited into the dormant gate, which will generate levels based on the types of minerals you deposited once the gate launches. \n\nBut if exciting new worlds mysteriously materializing from special minerals wasn't enough of a reason to mine the Clockworks, there's another perk...

r.minerals_rock_5a = Continue

# IMAGE: step5_getpaid.png
m.minerals_rock_6a = You get paid! The Birdsong Mining Company here in Haven has given full control of the Arcade over to the Spiral Knights in return for unearthing the treasures within the Clockworks. Basically, we do the heavy lifting and they pay each knight for every mineral deposited into a gate. \n\nSo in short: delve into the Clockworks, collect minerals, deposit them to build new worlds and get paid for doing it!

r.minerals_rock_6a = Sounds great! Thanks for the info!

m.alien_ooze = Alien Ooze
o.alien_ooze = Rescue the field research team from a lichen colony
b.alien_ooze = One of our field research teams is under siege from a large colony of lichens. Lichens are an alien species of the slime family thought to have come to the Clockworks via a meteor that crashed on to the surface of Cradle.  This particular species of slime is formed from innumerable smaller slimes that form mobile, sentient 'colonies.' \n\nLichen colonies can further combine to form larger and larger versions of themselves, rapidly evolving a range of deadly claws and barbs.  Prevent them from combining at all costs and save the research team!

m.toy_soldiers = Toy Soldiers
o.toy_soldiers = Destroy the Mecha Knight factory's production center
b.toy_soldiers = Recon Knights are reporting much greater numbers of mecha knights in the first stratum of the Clockworks and have discovered a mecha knight production facility close to Haven. \n\nMecha knights are believed to be gremlin-engineered sentries of the construct family that share many of the capabilities of a Spiral Knight.  Proceed with caution when seeking out the production center and then shut it down for good!

m.monstrous_research_2 = Monstrous Research
o.monstrous_research_2 = Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research.
b.monstrous_research_2 = By now you have likely collected some interesting materials in the first stratum of the Clockworks that would be useful to Spiral HQ.  Help advance their continued research of the mysteries of Cradle by donating materials.

# RANK 3-2

m.pioneers = The Pioneers
o.pioneers = Contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink
b.pioneers = After the crash of the Skylark, Captain Ozlo selected an elite squad of Spiral Knights to be the first to enter the Clockworks.  They were never seen again.  Contact Intel Agent Kora and learn how you will play a role in solving this mystery.

n.pioneers = Kora
m.pioneers_1a = Hello {0}, I hope you're doing well.  Something has come up that will require you to face your greatest challenge yet. \n\nI have an order from Spiral HQ that comes from Captain Ozlo himself.  You have been selected as one of the Knights to actively search for traces of the Alpha Squad.

r.pioneers_1a = Alpha Squad?  Sounds vaguely familiar...

m.pioneers_2a = It should, there're plenty of new recruits that chatter about them constantly. They're like heroes to some knights. \n\nThe Alpha Squad was an elite squad of knights that Ozlo personally selected to first enter the Clockworks in an effort to locate the source of the massive energy signal below.  Because all systems on the Skylark were offline for several weeks, radio communication was not possible.  Instead, they left a series of recon modules throughout their travels, sort of like a breadcrumb trail.

r.pioneers_2a = Continue

m.pioneers_3a = When our technicians finally got the Skylark's communications systems online, we could not establish a link with the Alpha Squad and they have never been heard from since. Their channel is completely dead. \n\nTheir dead line is what has us all scratching our heads.  Our comlinks are built to withstand all manners of extreme conditions, even explosions.  Heck, they survived the Skylark going down after all.  There's nothing I can think of that could kill the link completely.

r.pioneers_3a = Where do I come in to all of this?

m.pioneers_4a = We need you to discover what happened to them.  You'll start by seeking out known locations of their recon modules and collecting them for analysis.  I will be in charge of locating their general whereabouts and directing you toward them.  It's your job to go into the wild to retrieve them. \n\nAdditionally, I'll provide you with a quick background of each of the four members of the Alpha Squad: Squad Leader Euclid, Squad Guardian Grantz, Squad Recon Parma, and Squad Technician Rulen.

r.pioneers_4a = Tell me about Squad Leader Euclid.

m.pioneers_5a = Euclid wasn't your typical knight.  By the time most in his division were getting their Squire crest, he had already achieved Vanguard.  As a Squad Leader, he lead a series of successful assaults against the Morai during the liberation of Ilsora.  A brilliant tactician, he was known for getting the job done with half the knights of other squads.

r.pioneers_5a = Continue

m.pioneers_6a = It was for this reason that Ozlo selected him to take a small squad down into the unknown depths of the Clockworks.  After all, if you cut your teeth battling under Morai typhoon fire you could probably handle anything right? \n\nBut maybe the Clockworks proved too much for even his ability.  We just don't know.

r.pioneers_6a =  Tell me about Squad Guardian Grantz.

m.pioneers_7a = Grantz was the real veteran of the bunch.  A seasoned Guardian, Grantz specialized in keeping his squad safe, namely by crushing anything that would mean to do them harm. \n\nGrantz took his Guardian's Oath very seriously, often putting himself directly in harm's way in order to protect another.  The guy was selfless.  I imagine that if disaster truly befell the Alpha Squad, Grantz didn't let it end without one hell of a fight.

r.pioneers_7a = Tell me about Squad Recon Parma.

m.pioneers_8a = Parma was the youngest of the bunch, a very talented Recon, but with little combat experience.  She and I went to academy together and I can remember the day when the simulator technicians had thought their program was busted due to Parma's performance.  She actually apologized! \n\nBut still, I'm worried about her.  From the reports that I've read, the Clockworks are unlike anything we've ever encountered.  I only hope that as she keeps them informed of what's ahead, that they will watch her back.

r.pioneers_8a = Tell me about Squad Technician Rulen.

m.pioneers_9a = Rulen was recruited as the technical genius that Captain Ozlo believed would be required for navigating the vast, mechanized world of the Clockworks.  His primary responsibilities included everything from disabling locks to repairing armor to wrecking sentient constructs.  He was additionally the lead on analyzing the Core once the squad reached it.

r.pioneers_9a = Continue

m.pioneers_10a = Rulen was very... logical.  I think he was very aware of the odds we have of reaching the Core and then doing something with it in order to restore the Skylark.  I think Rulen knew exactly what kind of mission he was undertaking when they made their first descent into the darkness of the Clockworks.

r.pioneers_10a = So where do I start?

m.pioneers_11a = Right, down to business.  We've located an Alpha Squad recon module in an area of the Clockworks known as the 'Gloaming Wildwoods.'  However, this particular zone is home to a horrible creature known as 'the Snarbolax.' \n\nThe Snarbolax has made fast work of Squires like yourself, but I know you can handle it, {0}. But you're going to need to prepare.  I've issued you a series of missions that will allow you to assemble a loadout fit for taking on this terrible beast and reclaiming that recon module!

r.pioneers_11a = I'll do my best to recover the recon module and destroy the Snarbolax!

m.pioneers_12a = We're counting on you, {0}.

r.pioneers_12a = \u7ed3\u675f\u5bf9\u8bdd

m.faith_armor = Faith in Armor
o.faith_armor = Navigate the trap-filled chamber and rescue the apprentice, Wilks
b.faith_armor = An apprentice named Wilks who had just arrived from a Rescue Camp has found himself in what Spiral HQ calls a 'Trap Chamber.'  These levels of most likely gremlin design seem to be specifically built to trap and ultimately eliminate those attempting to explore the Clockworks. \n\nWilks probably didn't know what he had got himself into until it was too late.  Now he's stuck somewhere in the chamber and needs your help. \n\nSome traps can be avoided and sometimes you may find that you just have to take the hit. In saving Wilks, you will no doubt learn the true value of strong armor.

m.strength_unity = Strength in Unity
o.strength_unity = Defend the Geo Knights from a monstrous assault
b.strength_unity = Something has riled up a pack of beasts in the Aurora Isles and they have descended upon a Geo Knight research team.  Cornered, the team has sent a distress signal and Spiral HQ has issued the task of saving them to you. \n\nBy standing together, the Geo Knights have made it this long but their time is running out. Assemble a team and confront the beasts that seek to devour your fellow knights!

m.blades_fallen = Blades of the Fallen
o.blades_fallen = Place the sword of an unknown knight at the memorial in the soldier's graveyard
b.blades_fallen = Not every knight who enters the Clockworks returns to feel the sun on their face once more.  Within the perilous depths of the Clockworks, those that brave its dangers always face the reality that every expedition may be their last.  Sometimes their bodies can be recovered and other times all that is left is remnants of their gear. \n\nJust outside of Haven, Spiral HQ has built a soldier's graveyard where fallen knights can lay to rest.  As a Spiral Knight, you must face the reality of death in order to understand its gravity. \n\nDeliver the remains of an unknown knight, a sword, to a memorial within the graveyard.  But stay alert- dark energies resonate from the graveyard, attracted to the countless souls it houses.

# RENAMED FROM roar_snarbolax
m.shadow_beast = Shadow of the Beast
o.shadow_beast = Defeat the Snarbolax in the Gloaming Wildwoods and recover the recon module
b.shadow_beast = Spiral HQ has detected a recon module left by the Alpha Squad somewhere within the Gloaming Wildwoods.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\nThe Gloaming Wildwoods is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past. Because of this, Tech Knights have placed Beast Bells throughout the area. Striking them should stun any beasts caught within the sound wave they produce. \n\nBe advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes which we have not seen before stalking this forest.  Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry.  Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible.

# RANK 4-1
m.new_chapter = A New Chapter
o.new_chapter = Contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink
b.new_chapter = Having defeated the Snarbolax and recovered the Alpha Squad recon module, it's time to check in with Intel Agent Kora to get a report on the analysis of the module and information about certification in the Hall of Heroes.

n.new_chapter = Kora

m.new_chapter_1a = Congratulations on becoming a Soldier, {0}!  I hear you really gave that Snarbolax a clobbering, well done! \n\nWe've had an opportunity to analyze Euclid's recon module you discovered in the Snarbolax's lair.  Based on the recording, it seems that Euclid suspected something our Geo Knights discovered sometime after the crash- that the levels within the Clockworks are comprised of terrain from multiple alien worlds!

r.new_chapter_1a = What? How is that possible?

m.new_chapter_2a = We can't say for sure just yet, but it would seem as though that however Cradle was formed, it included large pieces of other worlds around it.  If this is true then we've never seen anything like this before.

r.new_chapter_2a = What a strange world.  What else do you have for me, Kora?

m.new_chapter_3a = Spiral HQ has authorized you to visit the Hall of Heroes and receive your 2 Star Certification. \n\nThe Hall of Heroes is a place where Knights rising in the ranks like yourself will visit to both learn about and acquire new recipes for gear as well as receive certification to go deeper into the Clockworks. \n\nYour first visit requires only that you wear all 2 Star gear, which you already have so it should be a piece of cake!

r.new_chapter_3a = Thanks Kora, I'll do my best!

m.shopping_again = Let's Go Shopping Again!
o.shopping_again = Follow Bechamel on a tour of the Bazaar's more advanced offerings
b.shopping_again = Bechamel has already given you a tour of the Haven Bazaar that included where to acquire new weapons, armor and recipes.  Now it's time to pay him another visit and learn about some of the more advanced services the Bazaar offers. \n\nYou will pay a visit to Punch and Vise, Brinks and even visit Bechamel's own shop!

n.shopping_again = Bechamel
m.shopping_again_1a = Hi there {0}!  Wow, you've made Soldier already?  You're really moving up fast in the ranks. \n\nAnyway, I'm here to give you a tour of some of the Bazaar's more advanced services. To start, do you want to learn how to even further power up that gear of yours?

r.shopping_again_1a = Do I ever!

m.shopping_again_2a = Who doesn't right?  Let's head over to Punch and Vise's workshop.

r.shopping_again_2a = (Follow Bechamel)
#(move to Punch and Vise)

m.shopping_again_3a = Punch and Vise are gremlin smiths that can change the properties of your weapons and gear.

r.shopping_again_3a = Gremlins?!

m.shopping_again_4a = Take it easy {0}, not all gremlins are cut from the same cloth.  Some disagree with the ways of King Tinkinzar and the Crimson Order.  In fact, somewhere down in the Clockworks I'm told there's an entire town full of gremlins who left the Great Colony.

r.shopping_again_4a = Well, if you say so...

m.shopping_again_5a = Ok, back to business then. \n\nPunch can add Unique Variants, a kind of special bonus to your weapons and gear for a price. But his methods are, er... chaotic.  You never really know what you're going to get. \n\nVise is a little more precise.  He can unbind your weapons and gear for a price, allowing you to sell or gift the item again!

r.shopping_again_5a = Handy, I'll keep it in mind.  What else you got?

m.shopping_again_6a = Let's go visit Brinks.

r.shopping_again_6a = (Follow Bechamel)
#(move to Brinks)

m.shopping_again_7a = Brinks is the Token Trader, issuing certain items to Knights in exchange for tokens that can be collected within the Clockworks.  Tokens can be found in treasure blocks, issued as mission rewards or found when defeating special boss monsters.

r.shopping_again_7a = I've got it.  Anything else?

m.shopping_again_8a = Just one last shop to visit and then we're done. I've saved the best for last.

r.shopping_again_8a = (Follow Bechamel)
#(move to Bechamel)

m.shopping_again_9a = Here we have... me!  I'm the Accessorizor, adding accessories to your gear so long as you have a ticket.  With accessories, you can make your gear really stand out in a crowd, I highly suggest giving it a try.  You'll soon become the apple of every one's eye!

r.shopping_again_9a = Where do I find accessory tickets?

m.shopping_again_10a = You can find accessory tickets inside lockboxes or at the Auction House if another Knight happens to be selling them.

r.shopping_again_10a = Roger.

m.shopping_again_11a = Well, that about covers the basics of the Bazaar.  It's a really fantastic place to find just about anything you need. \n\nDo you want me to go over it all again or do you think you've got it?

r.shopping_again_11a = I'd like you to give me the tour once more.
r.shopping_again_11b = I think I've got it Bechamel, thanks!

m.shopping_again_12a = No problem, I've got the time.  Let's head back to Punch and Vise.
r.shopping_again_12a = (Follow Bechamel)
#(starts at Punch and Vise)
m.shopping_again_12b = Wonderful!  I'm glad I could help you out.  Good luck and remember that I'll always be here to keep your armor looking unique!

r.shopping_again_12b = Thanks Bechamel, I'll be seeing you!

m.advanced_alchemy = Advanced Alchemy
o.advanced_alchemy = Visit Bosco and discover the potential of advanced alchemy
b.advanced_alchemy = Now that you have achieved the rank of Soldier, Bosco in the Haven Bazaar has some new information for you regarding advanced forms of alchemy.  Pay him a visit and learn about the hidden potential in some weapons and gear!

n.advanced_alchemy = Bosco
m.advanced_alchemy_1a = We meet again, {0}.  Spiral HQ has asked me to introduce you to some advanced alchemy.  Don't worry, this won't take long.  I've got an old mecha knight to work on anyway.

r.advanced_alchemy_1a = Lay it on me, Bosco.

m.advanced_alchemy_2a = Basically it comes down to 'branching.'  You see, most of the alchemy you have likely seen up to this point follows a linear evolution path.  It simply improves over time and each upgrade is better than the last. \n\nBut not all items are like that.  Many of them can become multiple, completely different types of items than their original!

r.advanced_alchemy_2a = Wow, sounds like I have a lot to learn!

m.advanced_alchemy_3a = You'll figure it out as you go along, trust me.  Take this Brandish for example.  It has within it the potential to become three different types of elemental blades that deliver powerful status conditions, or even a shadowy sword of darkness! \n\nYou just need to discover the recipes that require a brandish and get crafting to find out. Here, you can even keep this Brandish I've got.  Transmute it into something amazing.

r.advanced_alchemy_3a = Thanks Bosco!  I'll gather some recipes and get crafting!

m.hall_of_heroes_1 = Hall of Heroes
o.hall_of_heroes_1 = Visit the Hall of Heroes wearing at least 2 Star gear and receive certification
b.hall_of_heroes_1 = The Hall of Heroes is where knights go to receive their Star Certification allowing them to access deeper depths of the Clockworks.  Each certification ensures a knight meets the star level required to deal with challenges in the upcoming missions. \n\nThe Hall of Heroes also allows knights the opportunity to speak to veteran knights and discover their loadouts, even offering the opportunity to purchase recipes for these loadouts. \n\nVisit the Hall of Heroes and receive your 2 Star Certification in order to obtain access to missions within deeper levels of the Clockworks.

#Conversation (used at in the hall):
n.hall_of_heroes_1 = Barrus
m.hall_of_heroes_1_1a = Well met, {0}. I'm Lieutenant Barrus, Warden of the Hall of Heroes. \n\nYou are here because Spiral HQ has marked you as having potential to become a Vanguard of the Spiral Knights.  The Hall of Heroes is now at your disposal.  As you move up in rank, you will receive new missions to visit and have access to more recipes from the veteran knights in this hall.

r.hall_of_heroes_1_1a = I was told I am to receive Star Certification here?

m.hall_of_heroes_1_2a = Yes, in order to access deeper stratums of the Clockworks you must first receive Star Certification.  This entails speaking to me when you have equipped armor, a helmet, a shield and at least one weapon of a specific star level or greater.

r.hall_of_heroes_1_2a = Roger.

m.pierce_of_cake = Pierce of Cake
o.pierce_of_cake = Learn about monsters that inflict piercing damage
b.pierce_of_cake = Now that you are undertaking missions in 'Tier 2' of the Clockworks, monsters will begin inflicting special damage types that you need to be aware of and prepare for or else you could face certain doom! \n\nOne of our lead Biotechs, Hahn, has prepared a brief lesson on piercing monsters.  Speak with him via comlink before taking on any further missions.

n.pierce_of_cake = Hahn
m.pierce_of_cake_1a = Hello there, {0}.  Spiral HQ has informed me that you will be needing a quick lesson in the species of monsters within the Clockworks that inflict piercing damage, yes?

r.pierce_of_cake_1a = Yes, they said that-

m.pierce_of_cake_2a = Very well {0}, let's get right to it.  It seems the closer monsters get to the Core, the more their unique properties begin to surface.  In most cases this takes the form of their being able to inflict special damage types that require special defenses in order to withstand properly. \n\nIn Tier 2, a monster inflicting a special damage type will always produce a split normal/special damage output.  Thus, normal defense is still a somewhat valid defense choice.

r.pierce_of_cake_2a = Ah, so you're saying that-

m.pierce_of_cake_3a = Yes, at this point you must begin forming an arsenal that protects you against special damage types. \n\nYour current missions will have you facing monsters with piercing damage attacks.  Thus, you must begin acquiring helmets, armor and shields that defend against piercing damage.

r.pierce_of_cake_3a = What types of monsters inflict-

m.pierce_of_cake_4a = Piercing damage is produced by slime and beast family monsters. Additionally, slime monsters tend to be weak to shadow damage and beasts themselves to piercing damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?

r.pierce_of_cake_4a = You talked pretty fast, can you go over it-

This could prove disastrous for any levels in close proximity should the slimes enter the boilers and cause an explosion. \n\nMoorcroft Manor serves as an invaluable connection point into Tier 2 and its departed residents have been the most gracious of hosts.  It is in Spiral HQ's best interest to send a squad in to deal with the smoldering slimes before they create a firestorm that seals off our access to Tier 2. \n\nIt is up to you to locate the oilers and remove them from the boilers!

m.frostifur_fandango = Frostifur Fandango
o.frostifur_fandango = Hunt down the ferocious Snowclaw Pack
b.frostifur_fandango = Spiral HQ is receiving numerous reports of squads being wiped out by a pack of wolvers known as 'the Snowclaw Pack' near depth 10.  These ferocious frostifurs have an icy bite and are very territorial. Due to their relentless attacks, Spiral HQ is requesting an experienced squad infiltrate their den and destroy them to prevent any further casualties. \n\nIt is advised that you prepare yourself with piercing damage and freeze resistant gear before deploying.

o.rescues_and_recycling = Shut down the gremlin deconstruction site and rescue the captive knights
b.rescues_and_recycling = A 'Deconstruction Zone' is a gremlin work site where gremlins seem to tear apart existing levels and use the components to build new levels. Their ability to rapidly engineer levels and machines is incredible, surpassed only by their hostility to anyone who crosses their path. \n\nRecon Knights have discovered that a squad may have observed their engineering marvels a little too closely as they are now being held captive in one of the deconstruction sites near depth 10.  It is unclear what the gremlins have in store for these knights or if they simply plan on letting them perish along with the rest of the level they are dismantling.

m.shocking_sentient_sentries = Shocking Sentient Sentries
o.shocking_sentient_sentries = Battle your way to the secret weapons facility
b.shocking_sentient_sentries = Recon Knights have uncovered a secret weapons facility that according to the intel we have available, could belong to a high ranking gremlin of The Crimson Order.  It is heavily fortified by a small army of electrified constructs who have no doubt been programmed to defend the facility at all costs. \n\nWhile it is unclear if this weapons stash actually belongs to a gremlin of The Crimson Order, it is no less worth infiltrating and neutralizing the weapons stash. \n\nIt is advised that you prepare yourself with elemental damage and shock resistant gear before deploying.

m.shadow_knows_4a = Perhaps Geo-Science has no place in this conversation?  You are correct, {0}. \n\nMoving on, shadow damage is produced by fiend and undead family monsters.  Additionally, fiend monsters tend to be weak to piercing damage and the undead to elemental damage. Keep this in mind. \n\nNow then, is there anything else you require?

b.chilled_to_bone = By now you have no doubt run into strange, undead monsters known as 'spookats.'  Recon Knights have finally discovered what seems to be the source of these ghostly cat-like creatures. \n\nLarge concentrations of spookats have been sighted in what is believed to be the darkened remains of an owlite castle.  Dubbed the 'Candlestick Keep' this shadowy realm is only illuminated by a series of owlite candles.    \n\nProceed with caution while exploring outside the light of the candles.  Lurking in the dark are enormous spookats known as 'grimalkins.'  Grimalkins seem to withstand all weaponry and are to be avoided.  Your only defense is to stay in the light! \n\nSpiral HQ has issued you this mission in order to collect more data on the origins of the spookats and the mystery behind the fall of the owlites.  Investigate the Candlestick Keep and report your findings!

m.work_idle_hands = Work for Idle Hands
o.work_idle_hands = Crash the fiendish office party!
b.work_idle_hands = Devilites are a type of fiend that seem to have a very rigid corporate structure that governs their every action.  Recon Knights have discovered a series of devilite 'offices' throughout the Clockworks, typically found in the remains of an alien city. \n\nAnalysis of the data collected from these offices indicates that devilite corporations are outsourced by gremlins in order to design and manage various projects that include weapons specifically engineered to target Spiral Knight squads. \n\nIt's time these devilites were issued pink slips and their fiendish projects cancelled.

m.another_trace_1a = Hello {0}, I have new intel for you regarding another Alpha Squad recon module.  This one has been pinpointed to an area that Recon Knights have dubbed the 'Royal Jelly Palace.'

r.another_trace_1a = You're kidding me, right?

m.another_trace_2a = The place is as strange as it sounds.  Apparently, monsters within the slime family actually have a ruling aristocracy of elite slimes.  These 'Royal Jellies' are enormous, selfish and ill-tempered slimes that live in opulent palaces that we can only guess have been squatted in as we do not believe slimes are capable of building structures.

r.another_trace_2a = Ok...

m.another_trace_3a = The Alpha Squad recon module is located somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace and we need you to retrieve.  Royal Jellies are hoarders.  It would make sense that this module is somewhere in its personal quarters.  Be wary though, a Royal Jelly surrounds itself with plenty of protection.  You will likely face significant resistance as you investigate the palace.

o.time_enough_at_last = Discover the fate of the lost knight within the Scarlet Fortress
b.time_enough_at_last = A knight named Edger has gone missing while exploring the Scarlet Fortress.  Given that this crumbling castle is swarming with spookats and jelly cubes, his squadmates fear for his safety and have asked a more experienced knight like yourself to investigate. \n\nLocate Edger within the fortress and bring him back to Haven!

#Conversation (used at the end of the mission):
n.time_enough_at_last = Edger
m.time_enough_at_last_1a = Oh hello there.  I suppose you're with Spiral HQ.

r.time_enough_at_last_1a = Yes, you must be Edger.  Your squadmates requested that I come find you.

m.time_enough_at_last_2a = Ah yes, my squad.  A good bunch... strong and determined.  I'm not sure I really fit in to be honest, was always more of a reader!  They should be fine without me I would imagine.

r.time_enough_at_last_2a = Without you?  No, I'm here to bring you back.

m.time_enough_at_last_3a = I don't know about that... I'm fine here amongst all these ancient tomes.  I've got plenty to read, more than I ever could in a lifetime.  But I suppose that won't be a problem. \n\nPlease, just head on back to Haven.  Let my squad know that I'm ok and that I'm safe.

r.time_enough_at_last_3a = Safe?  This place is swarming with monsters!

m.time_enough_at_last_4a = Yes, it is isn't it?  I should not have come here alone.  I should have stayed with my squad. \n\n(Edger looks off into the distance) \n\nI don't even remember how it happened.... maybe I never will.  But it didn't hurt.

r.time_enough_at_last_4a = Are you saying that...?

m.rise_or_fall = Rise or Fall
o.rise_or_fall = Test your might with a slimy showdown in the Battle Arena
b.rise_or_fall = Infiltrating the Royal Jelly Palace and taking on the hordes of slimes that serve the great Royal Jelly is not going to be an easy task.  It is highly recommended you seek one of the 'Battle Arenas' within the Clockworks and determine if your equipment is up to the challenge of facing so many savage slimes. \n\nSpiral HQ has located one of these mysterious arenas that seems to be filled with all manner of gooey gladiators seeking a challenge.  Give them a good fight!

b.sovereign_slime = One of the Alpha Squad's recon modules is believed to be located somewhere in the Royal Jelly Palace, the home to one of the member's of the slime aristocracy, the Royal Jelly. \n\nThe might of these sovereign slimes is not to be underestimated.  Should you find yourself facing this hot-tempered highborn, you would be wise to be equipped with the appropriate gear and backed by a full squad of experienced knights. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with pierce resistant gear and shadow damage weapons before deploying for the Royal Jelly Palace!

We believe they are developing some kind of weapon they're calling 'Project R' that will be targeting Haven itself.  Spiral HQ and the Strangers themselves are requesting that you investigate the matter given your performance in the Royal Jelly Palace.

r.explosive_plot_3a = It's because the Strangers took us in that they're now targeted...

m.explosive_plot_4a = Yes, I feel the same way.  We owe it to them to put an end to this gremlin threat as quickly as possible. \n\nI've lined up several missions for you that will take you to locations where gremlins seem to be gathering resources for Project R.  Your briefing should explain everything.

m.axes_of_evil = Axes of Evil
o.axes_of_evil = Stop the gremlin logging operation in the Jigsaw Valley
b.axes_of_evil = A gremlin logging operation has been discovered in levels known as the 'Jigsaw Valley.'  These strangely carved islands are home to an even stranger species of twisting trees that gremlins seem to be determined to completely wipe out. \n\nSpiral HQ believes that gremlins are using the lumber from this operation as resources for the development of Project R and needs you to enter the Jigsaw Valley and shut it down.

m.plan_of_attack = Plan of Attack
o.plan_of_attack = Recover the gremlin schematics in the secret test lab
b.plan_of_attack = Deep within a toxic cavern lies a hidden test lab that gremlins have been using as a testing ground for components of Project R.  One of these components still in development is reported to have schematics for the project close by. \n\nIf this is true there will likely be a terminal of some kind close to one of Project R's components.  Locate the terminal and recover the schematics for analysis.  It should shed light on the exact nature of Project R.

m.high_temperature_hostages = High Temperature Hostages
o.high_temperature_hostages = Rescue the captured knights within the fiery Deconstruction Zone
b.high_temperature_hostages = Intel had reported a gremlin deconstruction crew dismantling a portion of the Clockworks in order to generate scrap resources for use in their Project R. Using powerful welding torches, they are truly burning the place to the ground. \n\nOne of the squads investigating the site has gone missing and is believed to be now held in captivity at the site. \n\nInfiltrate the fiery deconstruction zone and rescue the captive knights.  But be warned, the deconstruction crew are said to have a powerful security construct hidden somewhere on site.

o.target_acquired = Contact Intel Agent Kora via comlink
b.target_acquired = After analyzing the schematics you recovered from the gremlin test lab, Spiral HQ now knows the nature of Project R as well as its location within a gremlin munitions facility.  Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter this facility and destroy Project R before it can be used on Haven.  Speak with Intel Agent Kora for full details.

n.target_acquired = Kora
m.target_acquired_1a = Hello {0}, I hope you're ready for me to send you out into the lion's den once more.

r.target_acquired_1a = I understand that Spiral HQ has uncovered the nature of Project R.

m.target_acquired_2a = Yes, Project R appears to be in fact two massive weapons known as the 'Roarmulus Twins.'  Designed by one of the Crimson Order itself, the Roarmulus Twins are some kind of construct cannon that the gremlins intend on moving up the Clockworks into the Haven Arcade! \n\nBased on what the schematics suggest, their power far exceeds standard gremlin weaponry and could be truly devastating to Haven, Spiral HQ and the Strangers should it reach the Arcade.

r.target_acquired_2a = If you know where it is, I'll put a stop to it.

m.target_acquired_3a = We have pinpointed its location to be in the deepest level of a gremlin facility known as the 'Ironclaw Munitions Factory.'  The factory is used for the production of all manners of gremlin weaponry and is highly dangerous, even to the gremlins working there. \n\nYou must prepare yourself for heavy resistance from shock-powered constructs and gremlins.

r.target_acquired_3a = I'll be sure to get my hands on the appropriate gear for the job.

m.target_acquired_4a = There's one last thing- it seems you won't be the first knight to have entered the Ironclaw Munitions Factory.  We've detected another Alpha Squad recon module somewhere within the factory.  Please attempt to recover it.  I hope that analysis proves that Euclid's squad made it out of there alive...

r.target_acquired_4a = Roger that Kora.

m.whipping_mishandling =  Whipping and Mishandling
o.whipping_mishandling = Deliver the supplies to the research team within the fiendish city of Sol' Fork
b.whipping_mishandling = After Recon Knights discovered a fiendish city known as Sol' Fork, Spiral HQ deployed a research team to station itself in the heart of the city and study the devilites within.  Their findings have become the basis for our understanding of devilite culture and their motives for working with gremlins. \n\nThis research team is in desperate need of supplies in order to maintain working on-site.  It would be of great help to Spiral HQ's continued research to have a squad enter the city and deliver the necessary supplies.

m.sewer_stash = Sewer Stash
o.sewer_stash = Destroy the gremlin war machines hidden in the wasteworks
b.sewer_stash = It seems that the Ironclaw Munitions Factory is not the only place gremlins are storing high-powered weaponry.  Intel suggests that once manufactured, weapons are moved out of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory and stored in secret weapon caches throughout the Clockworks. \n\nOne of these caches has been uncovered in one of the Clockwork's wasteworks systems.  It's likely not going to be pretty reaching it, but eliminating the weapons stored in these wasteworks could result in far fewer casualties in the future.

m.built_to_destroy = Built to Destroy!
o.built_to_destroy = Dismantle the Roarmulus Twins in the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory
b.built_to_destroy = Once known to Spiral HQ as 'Project R,' the Roarmulus Twins have been identified as a gremlin-engineered weapon of tremendous power built with the sole purpose of destroying Haven.  Stored deep within the heart of the Ironclaw Munitions Factory, this weapon is not only protected by hordes of shock-powered constructs and gremlins, but the factory is a highly dangerous, explosive hazard itself! \n\nIn addition to shutting down the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to recover the Alpha Squad recon module that is believed to be located somewhere within the factory. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you form a full squad before deploying.

m.hall_of_heroes_3 = Hall of Heroes
o.hall_of_heroes_3 = Visit the Hall of Heroes wearing at least 4 Star gear and receive certification
b.hall_of_heroes_3 = In order to venture even deeper within the Clockworks you must visit the Hall of Heroes and speak to Lieutenant Barrus to receive your 4 Star Certification.

#Conversation (used at in the hall):

r.darkest_depths_1a = Thank you Kora, I'm just as glad as anyone to have Haven safe once more.

m.darkest_depths_2a = Yes, it has become something of a second home for us hasn't it?  Almost like we belong here, it's strange.

r.darkest_depths_2a = What do you mean?

m.darkest_depths_3a = It's just a feeling really.  I hear it from some of the other knights as well: a feeling like we... belong here, like maybe the crash occurred for a reason. \n\nBut that just can't be, right?  In any case, I'm rambling now.  Back to the mission!

r.darkest_depths_3a = What's the scoop, Kora?

m.darkest_depths_4a = As a Defender, you can now undertake missions in Tier 3 of the Clockworks.  These are the deepest and most dangerous depths of the Clockworks, delve any further and you will reach the Core itself. \n\nPerhaps if you make it that far, you can locate the Alpha Squad, I just don't know.

m.alchemy_mastery_2a = A good sword is, well, good and all, but how about a great sword? If you want weapons that will shake the heavens, then mastery level alchemy is what you need. \n\nOnce you craft an item into its 4 and 5 star incarnation, you unlock that item's true hidden potential.

r.alchemy_mastery_2a = Sounds impressive.

m.alchemy_mastery_3a = At 4 and 5 star level, gear offers the best protection you can find and weapons pack the biggest punch.  If you want to stay alive where you're heading, you need to start building an arsenal of 4 and 5 star gear. \n\nAnd remember- as items reach 5 star they typically can branch even more than before.  Your combat options are about to really open up.  Plan your arsenal with care.

m.best_of_beast_1a = Hello {0}, good to see you still standing.  While normally not the concern of a Chief Biotech, I specifically requested the opportunity to inform you about the dangers that lie ahead for you in Tier 3 of the Clockworks.  Can't have you winding up dead as a result of some junior Biotech's misinformation.

r.best_of_beast_1a = Well thanks Hahn, it's almost as if-

m.best_of_beast_2a = Yes well, let's get started then. \n\nTier 3 is closest to the Core and much like how high level items respond to its power, so do monsters.  Many of them take on new forms and are considered at their most dangerous.  You must prepare before taking on each mission.

r.best_of_beast_2a = I understand my upcoming missions will have me facing mostly beast and slime monsters.

Now they've sent out a distress signal stating that they're cornered at depth 21 by chromalisks of all varieties. \n\nBiotechs speculate these chromalisks are agitated due to their proximity to the Core.

r.creators_and_created_1a = That and a solid arsenal, yeah.

m.creators_and_created_2a = Firepower will only get you so far, {0}.  Case in point, the gremlins are no doubt strong on their own, what with just sheer numbers and all, but these little, furry geniuses sought to also bolster their strength by creating an army of constructs.

r.creators_and_created_2a = So all constructs in the Clockworks were created by the gremlins?

m.creators_and_created_3a = Not all, but most of them are believed to have been directly manufactured from gremlin design, yes.  We think that most were originally engineered during the building of the Clockworks.  Some remain under gremlin control, others have gone rogue and the rest have become something else entirely.

r.creators_and_created_3a = What do you mean?

m.creators_and_created_4a = We've had a few cases where knights have met non-hostile constructs that they swear behaved like true sentient creatures.  But that is very difficult to believe. Gremlins are brilliant, but brilliant at the kind of direct engineering that simply gets the job done and little else.  Brute force. \n\nArtificial life?  Well, that's something else entirely.

r.creators_and_created_4a = Let's talk about the hostile ones I'm likely to meet.

m.creators_and_created_5a = Right.  Spiral HQ has informed me you'll likely be facing hordes of gremlins and constructs on this next go around.  Keep in mind that in Tier 3, these monsters can inflict pure elemental damage.  Do be sure to gear up appropriately.

b.beyond_axes_of_evil = Despite your previous efforts, gremlins have reformed their logging operation in the Jigsaw Valley in order to supply their munitions plants with resources. Given the results of their last project, the Roarmulus Twins, Spiral HQ would like you to end their eco-destruction before it becomes anything more serious!

m.spark_roar = Spark and Roar
o.spark_roar = Prove your valor against a legion of elite elemental monsters
b.spark_roar = Unlike other monsters, constructs don't seem capable of reproducing on their own, meaning that any time one is deconstructed, it's a permanent dent in their numbers. \n\nHaving recently found a series of levels with an exceptionally high concentration of constructs and the existing need of extensive combat data of Tier 3 constructs, Spiral HQ is requesting that you enter these levels and eliminate the construct threat, collecting combat data as you go.  It would prove instrumental in their continued research. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with elemental resistant gear with elemental and shadow damage weapons!

m.monstrous_research_7 = Monstrous Research
o.monstrous_research_7 = Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research
b.monstrous_research_7 = Having fought the elite Darkfang Clan gremlins, evaded the crushing blows of lumbers and withstood the optic blasts of retrodes, you have no doubt collected samples from these encounters that would be of great use to Spiral HQ's research teams.

n.darkest_forces = Hahn
m.darkest_forces_1a = {0}, still holding it together I see and earning the rank of Defender Elite no less.  Bravo. \n\nI've had a chance to analyze your combat data from your last mission and it's proving quite interesting.  The mecha knights in particular appear to actually be reacting to your attacks as if improvising.  But I can't say just yet. \n\nIn any case, that's not relevant to today's data that I'm presenting.

r.darkest_forces_1a = Yes, my next missions will have me facing fiends and undead.  Sounds fun.

m.darkest_forces_2a = You have a strange definition of recreation if that's the case.  Tier 3 fiends and undead are nothing to sneeze at, in fact they're among the worst creatures you'll find so close to the Core. \n\nDevilite management seems to be the worst at these depths and that results in some very violent devilites.

r.darkest_forces_2a = They weren't exactly easy going to begin with...

m.darkest_forces_3a = Exactly, and they're worse now.  And the same goes for the undead.  You'll find that howlitzers become particularly bothersome with their enhanced firing and homing capabilities. \n\nLastly, prepare for fiend and undead monsters to potentially deal pure shadow damage.  As always, choose the right gear for the job should you want to live long enough to hear from me again.

r.darkest_forces_3a = Well, I certainly wouldn't want to miss that.

o.return_of_ur = Stop the devilites from summoning an army of nightmarish trojan warriors
b.return_of_ur = A Recon squad has reported that deep within a fiendish city, devilites are attempting to summon a legion of powerful trojan warriors.  Based on intel from a devilite internal memo, the trojans are known as the 'Legion of Ur,' and are said to have once numbered in the thousands.  Strangely, the memo indicated that the Legion of Ur was sealed away in the Underworld and that an alternative approach would be required for bringing them back. \n\nWhatever means the devilites intend to use to bring a few thousand trojans into the Clockworks, they must be stopped.  Infiltrate their city and stop the fiendish army before they become unstoppable!

m.weight_of_darkness = \u9ed1\u6697\u6709\u591a\u91cd?
o.weight_of_darkness = Prove your valor against a legion of supreme shadow monsters
b.weight_of_darkness = It is speculated that all fiends within the Clockworks crossed over from a dimension known as the Underworld.  While how they crossed over and what their motives are on Cradle is unclear, data collected from fiendish cities seems to indicate that they are now stranded on Cradle, much like us. \n\nThe undead on the other hand remain a mystery.  Why spirits return to the material realm is unknown, though it is clear that many of the spirits within the Clockworks have come from other worlds.  Given how hostile these creatures can be, the only way to obtain useful data is through direct interactions, like combat. \n\nSpiral HQ is requesting that you collect combat data for the powerful fiend and undead monsters in Tier 3 of the Clockworks in order to better understand the nature of these creatures. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you equip yourself with shadow resistant gear with elemental and piercing damage weapons!

m.monstrous_research_8 = Monstrous Research
o.monstrous_research_8 = Turn in the requested materials to Spiral HQ for research
b.monstrous_research_8 = Having smashed the most terrifying zombies to dust, escaped the cold maws of grimalkins and stood victorious in battle against an army of trojans, you have no doubt collected samples from these encounters that would be of great use to Spiral HQ's research teams.

m.becoming_champion_1a = Well met {0}, it has been some time since I first met you having just arrived from the Rescue Camp.  You've come along way since then, rising to the rank of Defender Elite no less. \n\nYou are a gifted soldier, {0}.  I have no doubt you will soon be a Champion amongst the Spiral Knights and instrumental in our solving the great mystery that is the Core, restoring the Skylark and returning home.  You have proven that you have what it takes to face the legions of dark forces that lurk below the surface.

r.becoming_champion_1a = I'll fight to the very end, Lieutenant.  I know what's at stake.

m.becoming_champion_2a = I've heard Spiral HQ has lined up for you some missions befitting a true Champion.  But in order to become one, you'll need the right gear. \n\nI am entrusting you with the tools you will need to become such a Champion.  With these recipes, you can craft the highest caliber of gear of the Spiral Order.  With it you can finally wear the armor of the Azure Guardian, wield the might of the Leviathan Blade, and face anything in the protection of the Aegis.

r.becoming_champion_2a = I am honored, Lieutenant.

m.becoming_champion_3a = Then use them with honor and let them protect you from the fury of the countless foes you will soon face.  The Core that we seek, there's something truly dreadful about it.  I know that it may very well be what gets us home, but I can't shake this feeling that we've been thinking about it all wrong.

r.becoming_champion_3a = What do you mean?

m.becoming_champion_4a = I mean that the Core isn't a big battery that runs this world, but rather it and the whole of this world is a massive prison designed to keep something from ever leaving. \n\nThink about our geo-scans of Cradle just before the crash- they show it as being composed of hundreds of massive slabs of other worlds, almost like plates of armor.  Then you have the Clockworks, the most unnatural thing I've ever seen.  An entire world whose sole purpose seems to be stopping anyone from ever reaching its Core.

r.becoming_champion_4a = I think you're on to something, Lieutenant.

m.becoming_champion_5a = I've been talking with Spiral HQ about it now for some time and they're prepared to investigate it further.  Though I don't think I'll be changing their mind about trying to open the Core any time soon.  That's still priority number one for now. \n\nAll I can say is be careful out there, {0}.

r.becoming_champion_5a = Roger that.

m.vile_engine = The Vile Engine
o.vile_engine = Locate and destroy the bizarre slime generators below the lichen colony
b.vile_engine = Somewhere below a level that lichens have taken to inhabiting lies a strange facility of unknown origin that seems to be used for the production of toxic slime monsters. The 'slime generators' are capable of rapidly producing slime monsters that then quickly populate nearby levels. \n\nSquads in neighboring levels have already reported overwhelming numbers of toxic slimes, making it impossible to lead expeditions beyond depth 23.  It is time a knight of your caliber form a squad to infiltrate this strange facility and shut down production of these vile creatures. \n\nAny data that you could collect as to their origin would be highly valuable to Spiral HQ.

m.rotting_metropolis = The Rotting Metropolis
o.rotting_metropolis = Discover the fate of the lost squad in the toxic city
b.rotting_metropolis = It would seem as though those slime generators have been around much longer than we thought, seeping their vile toxins into any levels that should be near them. \n\nA modern city, much like those that the devilites inhabit seems to be overrun with these toxins, and was probably left behind by both the devilites and gremlins as a result.  Now a legion of slime and undead creatures haunt the place, festering in the poisons that linger in the air.  A squad that was attempting to pass through the city has gone missing.  Given that the very air is toxic, it is urgent that an experienced team enter this city and rescue the squad.  There is little hope left for them otherwise.

m.great_escape = The Great Escape
o.great_escape = Infiltrate the gremlin prison, free the captured Knights and stage an escape
b.great_escape = Recon Knights have collected intel that has revealed the gremlin 'Crimson Order' has begun ordering gremlins to build makeshift prisons within the Clockworks where Spiral Knights are being taken and imprisoned.  It is believed that these orders are coming in direct response to your destruction of the Roarmulus Twins. \n\nFurther data suggests that these makeshift prisons are a temporary solution until a larger facility can be built.  Spiral HQ however, has no intention of these imprisoned knights staying long enough to find out.

m.hall_of_heroes_4 = Hall of Heroes
o.hall_of_heroes_4 = Visit the Hall of Heroes wearing 5 Star gear and receive certification
b.hall_of_heroes_4 = In order to venture deep enough to reach the Core you must visit the Hall of Heroes and speak to Lieutenant Barrus to receive your 5 Star Certification.

n.ending_in_fire = Kora
m.ending_in_fire_1a = Hello {0}, and congratulations in rising to the rank of Champion.  Allow me to say that in my experience working with you that you are truly deserving of such a title.  It is because of you that so many knights have returned to the surface safely and that we know so much more about the Clockworks.

r.ending_in_fire_1a = Thanks Kora, I plan on being the first to reach the Core!

m.ending_in_fire_2a = At the rate you're going you just might, {0}!  Though based on new intel it would seem that's not going to be easy.

r.ending_in_fire_2a = What have you got for me?

m.ending_in_fire_3a = We thought things were getting pretty predictable, even at the depths you've been exploring.  The Core was in sight.  But now some kind of massive negative energy anomaly has surfaced above the Core, blocking access to it.  Recon Knights have said that all they see near it is fire, endless fire. \n\nWe don't know what it is just yet, but squads near that depth have already gone missing.  This is bad news.

r.ending_in_fire_3a = How can I help?

m.ending_in_fire_4a = We need you to explore the surrounding levels and collect any intel you can.  You can start with an Owlite castle of some sort that recently surfaced near this anomaly.

m.occurance_at_owlite_keep = An Occurrence at Owlite Keep
o.occurance_at_owlite_keep = Locate the ancient tome within the haunted Owlite keep
b.occurance_at_owlite_keep = An unlikely source of intel has surfaced from the residents of Moorcroft Manor.  A few of the spookats that call it home contacted one of our visiting Recon Knights and provided details of the negative energy mass that has appeared above the Core. \n\nCalling it 'a place of burning hatred' and 'a prison for dark souls' they say that you can read all about it in 'one of those weird Owlite books' in an Owlite keep they pinpointed. \n\nIf what they claim is true Spiral HQ could gain valuable intel from investigating the Owlite keep.  Just remember that these Owlite structures have all proven to be swarming with the lost souls of countless undead monsters.  Prepare accordingly.

n.occurance_at_owlite_keep = Owlite tome text:

m.silent_legion = The Silent Legion
o.silent_legion = Pursue Guardian Knight Arkus and bring him back to Haven
b.silent_legion = Guardian Knight Arkus was one of the finest warriors serving the Spiral Knights until some time shortly after the crash.  As one of the first to search for the Alpha Squad, Arkus's own squad perished in a grisly battle with a horde of dust zombies.  Since then, Arkus has blamed himself for their loss, saying that he betrayed his Guardian's Oath to protect his squad. \n\nArkus now journeys into the Clockworks alone, never risking the loss of another squad and we believe, somehow trying to find the squad he once lost.  As these expeditions began to appear self-destructive, Spiral HQ issued him a direct order to cease. \n\nArkus ignored these orders and has gone deep into the Clockworks and not returned.  Not wanting to lose the last member of his squad, Spiral HQ is asking you to pursue him to his last known whereabouts, some kind of mysterious statuary at depth 26.

I have been asked to let it go, to move on, but this I cannot do. \n\nTheir faces, their dying cries... they haunted me in my dreams, so I no longer sleep.  Now I see them when I close my eyes, so I shall not blink. \n\nI will remain here, among the stones... never blinking, never forgetting.


m.silent_legion_1a = Have they sent you for me?  To bring me back?  No, I am where I belong now. I no longer serve the Spiral Order and will remain here. \n\nLeave this place and never come back.  Leave me be.

m.silent_legion_2a = I could swear I heard them just now, their voices carrying in the wind.  No longer screams, no longer cries- whispers.  Indecipherable even in the stillness of this place.  Are they leaving me here?  Why must I be left behind? \n\nYou... I warned you not to proceed, to stay away from me.  Now you'll learn what they did... that those who are close to me die!

Pursued by some kind of terrible darkness we are forced into the unknown. \n\nAs we neared the Core- I don't know how to describe this really... the shadows came alive and began to attack us.  Rulen was enveloped in it and by the time Grantz freed him his body was badly burned.  He said it felt like both fire and ice. \n\nAnd then we could go no further.  As I record this, the darkness is nearly upon us, consuming the world we see, the light. \n\nBut then the Core, it began to open, filling this place with such a light, such an intense, blinding light.  Euclid has made the call; faced with darkness, we'll enter the Core, enter the light. \n\nThis will likely be my final recording.

m.eye_of_needle_2a = That mass of negative energy we've been investigating is a portion of an ancient kingdom called Almire, the very same realm described in that Owlite tome you discovered!

r.eye_of_needle_2a = But that tome suggested Almire was destroyed over a thousand years ago...

m.eye_of_needle_3a = Exactly!  So what the heck is it doing in the Clockworks now?  It just doesn't make any sense. \n\nSo, if we are to believe that indeed a lost kingdom from the past has somehow wound up in a massive, mechanical world in present day, the question remains, why?

r.eye_of_needle_3a = And why is it now blocking access to the Core, now that we're so close?

m.eye_of_needle_4a = It's all a bit too convenient.  But do gremlins really have this kind of power?  I suspect something more than even what they are capable of engineering. \n\nIn any case, this Almire, it's not a kingdom any longer.  All that remains is a great citadel that seems to be engulfed in never-ending flames that Spiral HQ has been calling the 'Firestorm Citadel.'  From what we can tell, the whole place is swarming with undead and built like a fortress.

r.eye_of_needle_4a = I take it the only way to the Core is through the Firestorm Citadel?

m.eye_of_needle_5a = It would seem so.  And this place, it just radiates evil, it's almost indescribable.  It's even starting to affect the levels surrounding it- fires are breaking out everywhere. \n\nYou're one of the best we've got, {0} and if there's anyone that could lead a squad through the citadel it's you.  But even reaching it won't be easy.  We're going to need to take care of a few fires and gather a bit more intel before storming the gates.

They say that a lost soul of the former Kingdom of Almire resides in a soldier's graveyard near the Firestorm Citadel.  This soul is willing to provide us with the information on the nature of the citadel as well as how we can get through it and reach the Core. \n\nReaching him will not be easy given his location.  Graveyards are terrible places, especially at this depth.  It is highly advisable that you move through the graveyard as quickly as possible in your search for this lost soul.

Even his family. \n\nMy family was lost too.  I fled the battle as soon as I saw the wave of flames in the distance.  I was able to reach my home just in time to see it burn.  I don't even remember how it ended.  I have no memory of my passing.

r.honor_duty_1a = It's been an honor to serve, Lieutenant.

m.honor_duty_2a = I've read your report of the Core, it's fascinating.  What an impossible structure and to think that the Alpha Squad might actually still be alive but... inside that thing is just incredible. \n\nI understand that Lieutenant Vaelyn has already led a team to the Core terminal and is establishing a base of operations for research.  This is of great value to all Spiral Knights and we have you to thank!

r.honor_duty_2a = I hope her findings produce something meaningful.

m.honor_duty_3a = Aye, as do we all. \n\nNow then, {0}, you need to prepare for what's to come.  Reaching the Core is only the beginning for us.  I suspect that Spiral HQ will be issuing you many more missions in the future that could only be taken on by someone of your ability. \n\nAnd finally, it is my pleasure to inform you that you will soon be awarded one of the greatest honors of the Spiral Knights, the rank of Vanguard.  I will see you in the Hall of Heroes.

m.search_continues_2a = The recon module you collected is very strange.  I have no reason to believe what Parma was saying isn't true, but how it happened I just can't say.  Everything about the Core suggests there are no 'doors' into it.  It's not a structure built to enter from the outside.  Rather, it seems just the opposite.

r.search_continues_2a = A prison to keep something inside?

m.search_continues_3a = Perhaps.  It certainly could be when you look at it.  We'll need to study it further.

r.search_continues_3a = And the 'living darkness' she described?

m.search_continues_4a = I don't know, but it is certainly a terrifying picture she has painted. Something stirs within the heart of this world, {0}, something terrible.  I've felt it since we first set foot on this world; invisible eyes watching our every move, shapes that form just out of view... something greater than gremlins calls this world home.

r.search_continues_4a = What will you do now, Lieutenant?

m.search_continues_5a = I haven't given up the search for Euclid, Parma, Grantz and Rulen.  They're out there somewhere and I will find them, even if it means entering the Core myself.
