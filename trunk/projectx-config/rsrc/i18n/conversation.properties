## HAVEN KNIGHTS

# Fountain
#...................................................................................................

n.fountain = Cort

m.fountain_1 = Greetings and welcome to Haven!  If you head north, you'll reach the Arcade where you can get up to speed on the details of our mission.  If you head west, you'll reach the Bazaar, where the Strangers have a selection of gear and weapons for sale.  Be sure to check their stock daily, it changes!

r.fountain_1 = Thanks for the information, I'm off to explore!

# Gym Signpost
#...................................................................................................

n.atg_guard = Keston

m.atg_guard = Greetings!  Beyond this door you will find the advanced training hall. As a Spiral Knight, you are free to use it to practice your skills and learn more about the Clockworks.

r.atg_guard = Thanks! I'll go see what's inside.


# Arcade Leader
#...................................................................................................

n.arc_leader = Feron

m.arc_leader_1 = Well met soldier, and good work on reaching our base camp here in Haven. I'm Lieutenant Feron. I have been assigned by Captain Ozlo to oversee our Clockworks mining operation.\n\nBefore you lies "the Arcade," a fascinating complex that serves as our link into the heart of the Clockworks. Since you're new here, I'll give you a quick run-down of what Spiral HQ has us doing here.

r.arc_leader_1 = Sure sounds important, tell me how it all works.

m.arc_leader_2 = After the Skylark crashed, its primary tearium core exploded, destroying a portion of the ship and leaving it without a main power source. Since so far we haven't found several hundred tons of tearium just lying around, the bird has effectively lost its wings.\n\nWith the help of the Strangers, we were able to set up a small base of operations here in Haven. Once we got our systems online, we discovered that within the heart of this rock resonates a power signature of unprecedented magnitude.

r.arc_leader_2 = If we could somehow harness that power...

m.arc_leader_3 = That's exactly right! The Core of the Clockworks could very well contain the energy source we need to create a new power source for the Skylark and restore it to operational condition. There's only one problem- the Clockworks themselves seem to be built like some kind of crazy death trap.\n\nReaching the Core is not going to be easy...

r.arc_leader_3 = I'm up to the task!

m.arc_leader_4 = That's the kind of spirit I like to see. It works like this: you use the gates up ahead to explore the Clockworks and retrieve special minerals. Then you deposit those minerals back in to gates to change the Clockworks below, creating new, unexplored levels.\n\nWe believe the minerals are the key to opening a path to the Core, we just need to discover how to use them!

r.arc_leader_4 = I understand my mission.

m.arc_leader_5 = You have proven that you are combat ready and I have faith that you will serve the Spiral Order courageously. The gates into the Clockworks are just up ahead. However, should you wish to know more about how minerals are used to construct gates, speak with Chief Geo Knight Wegner on the eastern platform. He's our main researcher on minerals in Haven.\n\nGood luck to you!

r.arc_leader_5 = End Conversation
r.arc_leader_5_accept = Reach Terminal 1? I'm on it!


# Wegner Basic
#...................................................................................................

n.arc_mintut = Wegner

m.arc_mintut_1 = Hello. I'm Wegner, Chief Geo Knight of the Skylark and head of geological studies within the Clockworks.

r.arc_mintut_1 = I'm here to learn about the minerals we have been assigned to collect.

# IMAGE: step1_minerals.png
m.arc_mintut_2 = During your travels in the Clockworks you will encounter five special minerals that we use to power these gates: crimsonite, moonstone, valestone, luminite and dark matter.\n\nWe use these minerals to power the gates in the Arcade and generate new levels to explore.

r.arc_mintut_2 = Continue

# IMAGE: step2_gather.png
m.arc_mintut_3 = You will find ore deposits in all levels of the Clockworks, and you must attack them in order to break them down into a size you can carry. You can only pick up one at a time, but you can swap them by picking up another. Look for the biggest, shiniest one you can find. They are the most valuable.\n\nOnce you safely reach the elevator, the mineral you are carrying gets deposited in your arsenal for use later. Everyone in your party gets everyone else's minerals, so no need to fight over who gets the best one!

r.arc_mintut_3 = Continue

# IMAGE: step3_deposit.png
m.arc_mintut_4 = Once you complete your expedition and return to the Arcade, you need to deposit your minerals into a dormant gate.\n\nSimply approach any of the deposit boxes in front of a dormant gate and press ATTACK to open the mineral deposit interface.

r.arc_mintut_4 = Continue

# IMAGE: step4_autosell.png
m.arc_mintut_5 = After opening the mineral deposit interface, simply press the "Auto Sell" button and all of your minerals will be deposited into the dormant gate, which will generate levels based on the types of minerals you deposited once the gate launches.\n\nBut if exciting new worlds mysteriously materializing from special minerals wasn't enough of a reason to mine the Clockworks, there's another perk...

r.arc_mintut_5 = Continue

# IMAGE: step5_getpaid.png
m.arc_mintut_6 = You get paid! The Birdsong Mining Company here in Haven has given full control of the Arcade over to the Spiral Knights in return for unearthing the treasures within the Clockworks. Basically, we do the heavy lifting and they pay each knight for every mineral deposited into a gate.\n\nSo in short: delve into the Clockworks, collect minerals, deposit them to build new worlds and get paid for doing it!

r.arc_mintut_6 = Sounds great! Thanks for the info!


# Wegner Advanced
#...................................................................................................

m.arc_mintut_adv_1 = If you have begun to deposit minerals in gates and wish to know more advanced information, I would be happy to share what I know.

m.arc_mintut_adv_1_alt1 = It's that easy! Deposit your minerals and receive crowns. If you wish to know more advanced information, I would be happy to share what I know.

r.arc_mintut_adv_1a = Please go over the basics one more time.

r.arc_mintut_adv_1b = I'm ready for your advanced lesson.

r.arc_mintut_adv_1c = Nothing at this time, thanks.

# IMAGE: stratum_themes.png
m.arc_mintut_adv_2 = The monitor stack that composes the columns of each gate displays the theme of the stratum it corresponds to, letting you know what to expect when you explore that section of the Clockworks.  There are themes that correspond to monster families and status conditions, but there may be others out there that we haven't discovered yet.

r.arc_mintut_adv_2 = How can I create a specific stratum theme?

#IMAGE: mineral_amounts.png
m.arc_mintut_adv_3 = The first step is to not just autosell your minerals.  Doing that is only going to get you the best price, not necessarily put the right mineral colors where you want them.\n\nWhen you deposit minerals, pay attention to the individual amounts of each mineral color.  Those amounts are what determines the theme.  Basically, there is a "recipe" that creates each theme.

r.arc_mintut_adv_3 = What are the recipes?

#IMAGE: mineral_recipes.png
m.arc_mintut_adv_4 = These are the recipes that we know so far.  There could be others out there. \n\nEach recipe requires that two mineral colors be the highest.  However, each recipe also has an 'anti-mineral' that if it is the third highest, will disrupt the recipe, changing the theme.  \n\nSo as you can see, there's a lot to these strange devices, and I expect we'll learn even more of their secrets in the future!

r.arc_mintut_adv_4 =  Wow, these minerals really rock!  Thanks for the info!

n.hav_snipes = Warnel

m.hav_snipes_1a = Please be careful not to step on any of the snipes, little one.

r.hav_snipes_1a = Snipes?

m.hav_snipes_2a = The snipes are the graceful, adorable, fetchingly-corpulent birds you see roaming about Haven. Some say they are the most beautiful creatures in the galaxy, but you would never hear that from the snipes themselves as they are incredibly modest.

r.hav_clock_1a = Tell me what you know about the Clockworks.

r.hav_clock_1b = Nothing at this time, thanks.

m.hav_clock_2a = I will share with you what I know, little one.

r.hav_clock_2a = How old are the Clockworks?

r.hav_clock_2b = How were the Clockworks created?

r.hav_clock_2c = What lies at the core of the Clockworks?

r.hav_clock_2d = On second thought, I've got some adventuring to do. Bye!

m.hav_clock_3a = It is hard to know exactly as so much of what is within seems to hold their origin from different worlds. Some appear to be from realms of great antiquity, no doubt once home to innumerable old gods and creatures.\n\nThis world is an unnatural one. What you see within it was never meant to be here. The great histories of so many worlds endlessly churning through the cogs of this great machine... I find it quite sad.

m.hav_clock_3b = There are different theories. Some say the gremlins that you see working on it now are responsible. But that seems too great even for their seemingly infinite work force. Even with the means to do so, how did they "start?" Where did they find the power?

m.hav_clock_3c = Something of immense power, little one. There is an enormous energy signal coming from the center of the Clockworks, but that is all we know. No one has ever made it to the core. Or at least if anyone has, they have never returned.\n\nThe ones to ask would be the gremlins, for they have likely gone deeper into the Clockworks than any creature. But that might prove difficult as they are quite a disagreeable lot.

r.hav_clock_3a = I've got another question.

r.hav_clock_3b = Thanks for the info tall guy, see you around town.

r.hav_grem_1a = Tell me what you know about the gremlins.

r.hav_grem_1b = Nothing at this time, thanks.

m.hav_grem_2a = My knowledge is yours, little one.

r.hav_grem_2a = What exactly are gremlins?

r.hav_grem_2b = Do the gremlins have a leader?

r.hav_grem_2c = Are there any friendly gremlins within the Clockworks?

r.hav_grem_2d = Actually, I have to run. Maybe some other time...

m.hav_grem_3a = Gremlins are a race of creatures who are incredibly adept at creating and dismantling all manners of machinery. They are at once a legion of brilliant artificers and a force of powerful destruction.

m.hav_grem_3b = All gremlins belonging to the colony serve King Tinkinzar. Tinkinzar is said to be a great ruler and mechanical genius, responsible for the vision of the whole of the Clockworks. It is our understanding however that the king is never seen by common gremlins, but instead his orders are delivered and carried out by his Crimson Order, a fearful and zealous band of gremlins who alone share audience with the great king.

m.hav_grem_3c = Most of them will attack you on sight, but there are some; outcasts from the colony, that have taken refuge in the towns below the surface. Theirs is a hard life, hated by their own kind and no longer in a world they call home.

r.hav_grem_3a = I've got another question.

r.hav_grem_3b = Thanks for the info tall guy, see you around town.

## TIER GUARD

# Tier Guard
#...................................................................................................

n.tier_guard = Spiral Warden

m.tier_1_requirements = Well met, knight. Before Spiral HQ can grant you access to the next tier, you must prove you have enough experience and the proper equipment to ensure your survival in the greater depth ahead. Your equipped armor, helmet, shield and a weapon must all have a 2-star or greater rating and you must have 15 tier-1 level completions.

m.tier_meets_requirements = Congratulations! You have earned entry into the next tier. But take heed, the challenges ahead are far greater than what you have faced up to this point. Tread carefully.

m.fc_greeter_1 = Heed my warning traveler; this is a dangerous and terrible realm. You stand before the gates of the Firestorm Citadel, the former heart of the great kingdom of Almire, now a dominion twisted by fire and malice.\n\nLeave this place if you want to live.

r.fc_greeter_1 = I've come this far, I need to move forward.

r.fc_bridge_1a = Vanaduke?

r.fc_bridge_1b = I need to keep moving.

m.fc_bridge_2 = Lord Vanaduke is the master of this broken realm. Once the king of Almire, Vanaduke now commands a terrible legion in the ashes of his former kingdom. You would do well to never cross his path.

r.fc_bridge_2 = I'm not here to make trouble with Vanaduke.

# Court Sprite 1
#...................................................................................................

n.fc_sprite = Sprite

m.fc_court_1 = You... you are not one of the lost. You must be strong to make it to this court. Please, you must help me!

r.fc_court_1 = Who would I be helping?

m.fc_court_2 = I am a sprite, a force of nature summoned to this realm to extinguish the unnatural fire that is consuming it. But Vanaduke discovered and imprisoned us. I managed to escape, but the other sprites remain in his custody.\n\nNow none may proceed beyond the court as columns of shadow fire block all exits. Shadow fire can only be extinguished with the water that flows from these spirit wells. The water is the purest found in all of nature, flowing directly from the springs within the realm of the Spirit Mother herself.

r.fc_court_2 = Those wells look dry...

m.fc_court_3 = Without the power of the rest of the sprites, water will never flow through this realm. It requires a focus link with the Spirit Mother to bring even the smallest of drops of water into such an oppressive world. The master of this realm has seen to it that the flames surrounding him will always burn.

r.fc_court_3 = I will free the sprites!

m.fc_court_4 = Then you are brave as well traveler. You can find my kinsfolk throughout the whole of this court. Be very careful though, for Vanaduke's terrible minions are guarding them. Many patrol the main drag, so watch your back as you move about.\n\nOnce you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation. When six others are reunited we will form a focus link with the Spirit Mother and bring water to the wells.

r.fc_court_4_accept = Free 6 Lost Sprites? I can do that!
r.fc_court_4 = I'll return soon.

m.fc_court_5 = May the Spirit Mother guide you.

r.fc_court_5 = End conversation


# Court Sprite 2

m.fc_court_reminder_1 = Once you find a sprite, carry them back to the sacred circle you see before you. They are no doubt weakened from Vanaduke's curse and will require rejuvenation.

r.fc_reminder_1 = End conversation


# Court Sprite 3
#...................................................................................................

m.fc_court_complete_1 = Our focus with the Spirit Mother is strong now thanks to you! Use the water that flows from the spirit wells to extinguish the shadow fire. The path ahead is is ridden with shadow fire and Vanaduke's minions and while we sprites can do little to aid you in battle, we can at least summon spirit wells in certain areas.

r.fc_court_complete_1 = This will greatly aid me, thank you.



## CORE RESEARCH

# Vaelyn
#...................................................................................................

n.core_lead = Vaelyn

m.core_lead_1 = Hail.  I am Lieutenant Vaelyn, commanding officer of on-site Core research.  You are clearly amongst the strongest of the Spiral Knights to reach these infernal depths, but strength alone will get you no further.

r.core_lead_1 = What's the situation Lieutenant?

m.core_lead_2 = We're attempting to find a means to activate the Core through the power of the minerals found within the Clockworks.  Those minerals are capable of transforming the Clockworks- we have seen this in the Haven Arcade.  It is our belief that we can use that power to activate the Core and... open it somehow.

r.core_lead_2 = You want to open it?

m.core_lead_3 = Yes, Captain Ozlo himself has ordered that we hold out as long as possible and learn whatever we can.  If we ever leave this planet, it will be because of this Core.  \n\nI am confident that aside from a potential energy source, the Core is a kind of nerve center for everything you see within the Clockworks.  You can feel it in what little air is down here; a wild, ominous sense that this is no mere machine.

r.core_lead_3 = You're saying it's what... alive?

m.core_lead_4 = I'm saying that we know this entire world isn't natural, and I for one don't believe that those hordes of miserable gremlins, no matter how industrious, could have built an entire world.  They had to have been aided by something far beyond their measure and perhaps whatever that is lies within the Core. \n\nThe same goes for the Alpha Squad.  They wouldn't just disappear, even within the furthest depths of the Clockworks.  They were our very best.  It was this Core that swallowed them.

r.core_lead_4 = But I thought there was no way inside it?

m.core_lead_5 = I don't know how, but they would have found a way.  They must have... and now they're gone.

r.core_lead_5 = End conversation

m.core_tech_1 = Welcome to the Core on-site research camp.  Got any news from the surface?

r.core_tech_1 = I'd like to know how I can help.

m.core_tech_2 = That's easy, keep gathering minerals within the Clockworks and powering those gates within the arcade.  We need to analyze how mineral power affects the Core.  The problem is that very little power reaches down to these depths.  We can only gather so much data from each gate as it launches.

r.core_tech_2 = Anything else?

m.core_tech_3 = Fresh air?  Warmth?  These depths are not an environment that many of us can stand much longer, but the Lieutenant insists that we keep at it, that maybe the surge of power from the next gate will provide us with the answer that we need. \n\nYou certainly can't argue that our Lieutenant isn't committed.  I don't think I've ever seen her close her eyes let alone sleep.

r.core_tech_3 = I'll continue to explore the Clockworks and collect the minerals needed for your research.

# Unnamed NPCs
