# Gloaming Wildwoods

s.wildwoods_start = Mission: Gloaming Wildwoods
m.wildwoods_start = Intel Agent Kora here, we've detected a recon module left by the Alpha Squad \
somewhere within this forest.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\n\
\
This forest is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past. \
Because of this, Tech Knights have placed Beast Bells throughout the area.  Striking them should \
stun any beasts caught within the sound wave they produce. \n\n\
\
Be advised that recon knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes which we \
have not seen before stalking this forest.  Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass \
of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry.  Should you encounter it, try and \
find a means of escape as fast as possible. \n\n\
\
Good luck!


# Royal Jelly Palace

s.royal_start = Mission: Royal Jelly Palace
m.royal_start = Intel Agent Kora here, we've detected another Recon Module of the Alpha Squad within \
this palace.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\n\
\
The Royal Jelly Palace is a strange place.  It appears to be some sort of castle that slimes have \
re-purposed as a residence for members of their oozing aristocracy.  Known as a 'Royal Jelly,' these \
noble slimes are said to rule over their countless loyal subjects with an iron fist-shaped appendage. \n\n\
\
Our intel suggests that the module is located somewhere near an enormous concentration of slimes, so it \
is reasonable to believe that it may be the 'throne room' of a Royal Jelly.  If so, be prepared for a \
fearsome fight- Royal Jellies are quick to anger and love to throw their enormous weight around.  Your \
best bet is to find a way to suppress their natural regenerative abilities. \n\n\
\
Good luck!


# Ironclaw Munitions Factory

s.ironclaw_start = Mission: Ironclaw Munitions Factory
m.ironclaw_start = Intel Agent Kora here, we have intercepted gremlin transmissions from this \
facility that indicate they are building some kind of weapon to destroy Haven!  It is your \
mission to infiltrate the facility, destroy this weapon and save Haven from destruction! \n\n\
\
Known only as 'Project Roarmulus,' it is said to be impenetrable from standard attacks.  You \
will have to find a way to break whatever armor it is using.  Intel suggests this weapon is \
located deep within the facility. \n\n\
\
But getting to it won't be easy.  You will find that gremlins have little care for a safe \
work environment as live rockets seem to be fired every which way at all times.  However \
you should be able to utilize the 'polarity walls' you will find in testing environments \
to block the oncoming rockets.  Look for a purple and gold switch to toggle them. \n\n\
\
We've also detected another Recon Module of the Alpha Squad somewhere in this \
factory.  Retrieve it if you can! \n\n\
\
Good luck!


# Firestorm Citadel

s.firestorm_start = Mission: Firestorm Citadel
m.firestorm_start = Intel Agent Kora here, at your current depth establishing communications is \
difficult- I hope you receive this message.  You currently stand in the Firestorm Citadel, some \
kind of ancient fortress that this planet apparently like to collect.  It is an incredibly hostile \
region of the Clockworks, you will not last long without the right gear and a talented squad. \n\n\
\
We have detected a faint signal that indicates some kind of artifact of the Alpha Squad's expedition \
is located within the throne room of this citadel.  We need you to recover this artifact- it could \
be a valuable clue for discovering their current whereabouts. \n\n\
\
I won't lie to you, no squad that has taken this mission has managed to return from the citadel.  As \
you have no doubt seen, the place burns with an unnatural fire and a legion of similarly unnatural \
horrors roam every hall.  Now may be a good time to turn back and craft some fire-resistant gear.  \
A trial by fire will only get you burned. \n\n\
\
Good luck!


# TF2/MannCo Promotional Hat Messages

s.tf2_start = A Small Task
m.tf2_start =G'Day, loyal customer! \n\n\
\
You may have recently heard that I've become the fourth richest man in America, having surpassed \
the fifth richest man in wealth, and having killed the previously-fourth richest man in a harpoon \
duel. While this is, of course, entirely true (especially the part about the harpoon duel, which was \
long and bloody), it's not nearly enough. Fourth place might be fine for HIPPIES who wouldn't know \
victory if it wandered up and offered to braid their ponytails, but it's damn well not good enough \
for Saxton Hale! \n\n\
\
Mister Reddy, my accountant, explained to me that the best way to light a fire under the backside of \
Mann Co.'s revenue would be to "open up new markets". I'd relate exactly how we plan on doing that \
to you, but as he was talking I immediately started doing military presses to keep from dying of \
boredom, and missed out on the intricate details. \n\n\
\
All you need to know, dear customer, is that I need a good man to find his way to a town called \
"Haven", bravely stride into one of the many gates there and then cut his way down to the first \
"Clockworks Terminal". Since we couldn't find a good man, you'll have to do it yourself. You'll be \
amply rewarded, of course: there's NOTHING I wouldn't do for an employee who risked life and limb on \
a trivial task necessitated by my selfish whims. \n\n\
\
Don't bother directly contacting me once you're done, as I'll be too busy kickboxing giraffes to \
care. One of my other employees will handle things from there. Best of luck: you'll need it! \n\n\
\
Sincerely yours, \n\n\
\
SAXTON HALE \n\
Australian \n\
CEO, Mann Co.


s.tf2_end = Task Confirmation
m.tf2_end = To Whom It May Concern: \n\n\

replica headwear. No refunds or exchanges will be offered for this reward, and Mann Co. is not \
liable for any injury sustained while attempting to use said reward. \n\n\
